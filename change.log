Version: 0.2 - 19.02.2020

Removed the Hash-as-Filename feature. It's confusing people as they can't remember what  the actually have donloaded.
Plus it raises a possible security concern. If you save a file with the hash as filename someone else could copy it and obtain the data.
The hashes will now being generated automatically. It's a sha256 + a random (urand) string.
Working on an authorization system. The idea is that a "client" gets autorized by its certificate (rather than by user/pwd). 
So cherrypy nneds to verify the client's cert fingerprint against a certain entry in the DB.

To do's:
Fix code (as usual ...)
Add checks for expire_date
Make the whole project "Docker ready"
Add Client-Cert verification
Add Fileselector for admin.py
Testing 

Version: 0.1 - 18.02.2020

Ok folks this is just a very alpha state version of Blindshare  
The idea is to provide your friends/folks with just a Hash that represent a single file you want to share  
They will then be able to surf to a Blindshare site, enter the hash and receive the file.  
To add some additional security, the file you'll receive is composed from the hash value (as filename) plus the suffix of the original file  

Prerequisites:

Python3  
Cherrypy (either by OS rpm/dep or from github: https://github.com/cherrypy/cherrypy )

git (in case you use the github version)  
docker (in case you want to containerize)  

To do's:  
Fix code ;)  
Add TLS for the Server  
Add TLS Client Cert verification (maybe)  
Add checks for expire_date  
Add global config for the Python scripts  
Make the whole project "Docker ready"  
Testing
